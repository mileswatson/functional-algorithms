# Functional Algorithms

This repo contains implementations of algorithms, most of which come from the AQA FM / OCR CS specifications for A Level. They are written in F#, as a means of improving my functional thinking.

## Game Theory

 - Play-safe value finder (both rows and columns, NxM)
 - Stable game checker (NxM)
 - Dominated-strategy remover (rows only, NxM)
 - Mixed strategy calculator (both rows and columns, 2x2 only)
